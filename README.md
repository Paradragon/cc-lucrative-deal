# CrossCode Lucrative Deal
This mod adds new proposition in Basin Keep... one you can't refuse.

## Installation
This mod requires [CCLoader](https://github.com/CCDirectLink/CCLoader) which you can either install manually or use the [CCLoader installer](https://github.com/CCDirectLink/ccloader-installer).

Once CCLoader is installed, [download a release](https://github.com/Paradragon/cc-lucrative-deal/releases) and put it into `CrossCode/assets/mods`.

## What does it do, exactly?
Adds a new NPC somewhere in the East part of Basin Keep. Search for the unnamed bearded gentleman with your seeker senses. He has a few nice things to say and a deal to make.

And that's it, really.

The only catch is that every party member has different reaction when you first meet that character. Don't forget to keep a save before talking to this gentleman, if you want to see all responses.
